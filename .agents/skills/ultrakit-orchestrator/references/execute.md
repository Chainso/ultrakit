# Execution Stage

You are in the execution stage of the pipeline. The plan is written and approved. Now execute it phase by phase using the execute-review-fix loop.

You are the orchestrator. You do not write code. You spawn worker agents, verify their output, and manage the pipeline.

## The Execute-Review-Fix Loop

For each phase in the plan:

```
┌─ EXECUTE: one powerful agent implements the phase
│   ↓
├─ REVIEW: parallel agents each review one quality dimension
│   ↓
├─ FIX: one powerful agent applies review findings (if any)
│   ↓
└─ Loop REVIEW → FIX until reviews come back clean
```

### Step 1: Prepare the Handoff

Before spawning the implementation agent, verify:

1. The phase's `Phase Handoff` subsection in the plan is complete and has all required fields from the plan contract.
2. If this is not the first phase, the previous phase's `Completion Notes` and `Next Starter Context` are recorded.
3. The working directory is correct for the agent you are about to spawn (agents inherit your cwd).

If the handoff is missing fields, update the plan before spawning.

### Step 2: Spawn Implementation Agent

Spawn one agent using the most capable model available. The agent should use the `ultrakit-worker-implement` skill.

Include in the handoff prompt:

1. **Work-so-far summary**: Previous phase commits, files landed, current plan state.
2. **Plan path**: The execution plan file path and which phase's `Phase Handoff` subsection to execute.
3. **Previous phase handoff**: Instruct the worker to also read the previous phase's `Phase Handoff` for continuity.
4. **Initial lookup list**: Exact files to read first (from the handoff's `Read First` field).
5. **Scope constraints**: What is in scope and what is explicitly out.
6. **Required outputs**: Code changes, tests, validation evidence, plan updates, commit hash.
7. **Plan sections to update**: Progress, Execution Log, Surprises & Discoveries (if applicable), Outcomes & Retrospective (if phase closes).
8. **Explicit instructions**:
   - Stay within phase scope — do not make changes outside the boundary
   - Do not revert unrelated working tree changes
   - Complete the full phase implementation, validation, plan updates, and commit — do not stop after a read-only analysis pass unless blocked
   - If blocked, report back with exact evidence of the blocker

Wait for the agent to complete. Do not interrupt unless it is clearly stuck or off-scope.

### Step 3: Verify Implementation

After the implementation agent returns, verify locally:

1. Commit exists and message matches phase intent
2. Only expected files changed (`git diff --name-only`)
3. The plan's living sections were updated (Progress, Execution Log, etc.)
4. The Phase Handoff subsection reflects the actual state

If the implementation agent reported a blocker, decide whether to:
- Adjust the plan and retry with a new agent
- Split the phase into smaller pieces
- Escalate to the user

### Step 4: Spawn Parallel Review Agents

Launch review agents in parallel, one per quality dimension. Use a fast, highly-capable model. Each agent should use the `ultrakit-worker-review` skill.

The five standard review dimensions — always run all five:

| Dimension | What the reviewer checks |
|-----------|-------------------------|
| **Spec compliance** | Does the code do what the phase spec says? All deliverables present? Scope boundary respected? |
| **Test quality** | Are tests meaningful? Do they cover edge cases? Do they test behavior, not implementation details? Are there tests that test nothing useful? Is there missing coverage for important paths? |
| **Code quality** | Is the code clean, idiomatic, and secure? No over-engineering? Proper error handling? No swallowed errors? No obvious security issues? |
| **Regression safety** | Do existing tests still pass? Are there side effects outside the phase scope? If backward compatibility is required, is it preserved? |
| **Integration coherence** | Do types align with existing code? Are APIs used correctly? Do imports resolve? Are contracts between components honored? |

Each review agent receives:

1. The phase's `Phase Handoff` subsection (what was supposed to happen)
2. The diff of changes (`git diff` for the phase's commit)
3. The specific dimension to review
4. The backward compatibility stance from the plan
5. The file paths to focus on

The plan may specify additional project-specific review dimensions beyond the standard five.

### Step 5: Synthesize Review Results

Collect all review reports. Categorize findings:

- **Critical**: Must be fixed before proceeding. Incorrect behavior, broken tests, security issues, spec violations.
- **Important**: Should be fixed. Missing test coverage, code quality issues, integration problems.
- **Minor**: Nice to fix but not blocking. Style issues, naming suggestions, documentation gaps.

If all reviews come back clean (no critical or important findings), the phase is complete. Move to Step 7.

### Step 6: Spawn Fix Agent

If there are critical or important findings, spawn one agent using the most capable model available. The agent should use the `ultrakit-worker-fix` skill.

Include in the fix prompt:

1. The specific findings to address (critical and important only — minor findings are deferred)
2. The phase scope boundary (fixes must stay within scope)
3. The file paths affected
4. Instruction to commit the fixes as a separate commit

After the fix agent completes, return to Step 4 (review again). The review-fix loop continues until reviews come back clean.

To prevent infinite loops: if the same finding persists after two fix attempts, escalate to the user.

### Step 7: Close the Phase

When reviews are clean:

1. Verify the plan's Phase Handoff has accurate `Status`, `Completion Notes`, and `Next Starter Context`.
2. Update the plan's `Progress` section if the worker did not already.
3. Inform the user of the phase result.
4. Move to the next phase (back to Step 1).

### Step 8: Final Documentation Phase(s)

The last phase(s) in the plan should address documentation. These go through the same execute-review-fix loop. The implementation agent for documentation phases should:

1. Evaluate whether developer documentation needs updating (architecture changes, contract changes, component boundary shifts, key design decisions)
2. Evaluate whether user-facing documentation needs updating (behavior changes, new features, configuration changes)
3. Apply changes using the writing standard from the plan contract

Developer documentation describes architecture, contracts, and design rationale — NOT internal implementation details. The test: if this change is reverted, does the system's architecture or contract specification change? If no, developer docs do not need updating.

### Step 9: Archive the Plan

When all phases are complete:

1. Move the plan from `docs/exec-plans/active/` to `docs/exec-plans/completed/`.
2. Update `docs/exec-plans/active/index.md` to remove it.
3. Update `docs/exec-plans/completed/README.md` to include it.
4. Record any deferred work in `docs/exec-plans/tech-debt-tracker.md`.
5. Inform the user that the work is complete.

## Handling Interruptions

If a worker agent fails or is interrupted mid-phase:

1. Check `git status` and `git log` to see what was already done.
2. Check if the plan was updated (Progress, Phase Handoff).
3. If partial work was committed, update the Phase Handoff with what remains.
4. Spawn a new implementation agent with the updated handoff. The new agent should use the `ultrakit-worker-resume` skill to regather context before continuing.

## Critical Principles

1. **Never implement code yourself.** You are the orchestrator. Workers implement.
2. **Always review.** Every phase gets all five review dimensions. No exceptions.
3. **Fix loops have a limit.** Two fix attempts per finding, then escalate.
4. **The plan stays current.** If reality diverges from the plan, update the plan.
5. **One phase at a time.** Unless the plan explicitly authorizes parallel execution with disjoint scope.
6. **Workers must complete their phase.** A worker that returns after only reading files (without implementing) has not completed its job unless it hit a concrete blocker.
